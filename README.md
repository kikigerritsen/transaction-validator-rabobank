## Technical decisions

- `Concurrently` is used to run both the front-end and back-end at the same time.
- For the front-end I took `NextJS` as a framework. It is easy to set up for data fetching, typescript and styling.
- For the back-end I took `ExpressJS` as a framework since it is the one framework I know how to use to set up a relative simple API.
